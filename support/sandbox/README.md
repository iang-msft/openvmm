# sandbox

Default-deny worker-process sandboxing for OpenVMM and OpenHCL.

A worker starts from `Profile::deny_all()` and is widened only by the explicit
grants its own crate declares, so confinement is default-deny by construction
rather than by remembering to lock things down. Linux is fully implemented; the
Windows LPAC launch data is produced but the worker-side half is not yet
implemented (it fails loud rather than running unconfined).

## The three stages

Sandboxing happens in three named, ordered stages:

1. **`prepare`** — runs in the *control* process, just before it spawns the
   worker. It returns a plain-data `SandboxProcessConfig` describing the
   child's launch environment (which Linux `CLONE_NEW*` flags to use, which
   handles stay inheritable, the child's identity, and — on Windows — the LPAC
   construction data). The caller merges that into whatever process builder it
   already owns and performs the spawn. This crate depends on neither `mesh`
   nor `pal`: it decides *what* the launch environment must be; the caller
   decides *how* to apply it.
2. **`apply`** — the **first statement of the worker's `main()`**. On Linux the
   worker configures the namespaces it was cloned into, then applies
   `pivot_root`, credential drop, hardening, `no_new_privs`, and optional
   seccomp. It must run before any thread is spawned, any async runtime starts,
   or any resource is opened.
3. **`tighten`** — an optional, additive-only ratchet a worker calls once it
   has finished initializing, to shed its init-only authority. It takes
   `Restrictions`, a type that can only ever *narrow*.

## Authoring a policy

Policies are Rust values built with a widening-only builder. Start from a
shipped base (see `sandbox::profiles`) or from `Profile::deny_all()`, then add
exactly the grants the worker needs:

```rust
use sandbox::{Network, Profile, Syscalls, profiles};

fn vtpm_profile() -> Profile {
    profiles::minimal()
        .name("vtpm")
        .read("/usr/lib")
        .read_write("/var/lib/vtpm")
        .network(Network::None)
        .syscalls(Syscalls::Deny(&[
            "execve", "socket", "connect",
        ]))
        .build()
}
```

`Syscalls::Deny` installs a curated **default-allow** seccomp filter: it always
blocks the built-in dangerous-syscall baseline (namespace-escape and kernel-CVE
vectors such as `mount`, `unshare`, `pivot_root`, `bpf` — see
[`docs/seccomp-denylist.md`](docs/seccomp-denylist.md)) plus any extra names you
list, and allows everything else. A worker's full set of *needed* syscalls can't
be reliably enumerated, so the filter denies what a sandboxed worker never
legitimately needs rather than trying to allowlist what it does.

Every builder call widens the default-deny profile only as requested:
filesystem and network methods grant exactly what is listed, and `syscalls`
installs the selected deny policy. Use `Network::Unrestricted` only for workers
that intentionally retain the caller's network namespace. Every sandbox
primitive selected by the profile is required — if the platform cannot honor
it, `apply` aborts rather than running with weaker confinement.

## Preparing the spawn (control process)

```rust
use sandbox::{HandleTag, Identity, RawHandle};

let preparation = sandbox::prepare(
    &vtpm_profile(),
    &Identity::default(),
    &[(HandleTag(0), RawHandle(log_fd as u64))],
)?;

// Merge `preparation` into your own process builder: keep
// `preparation.inherit_handles` inheritable, clone with
// `preparation.clone_flags`, honor `preparation.map_current_user`, set
// `preparation.uid` / `.gid`, and (on Windows) build the LPAC token from
// `preparation.windows`. Then exec the child.
```

Handle hygiene is the caller's job: there is no grant envelope and no
descriptor sweep inside this crate. `prepare` reports exactly which tagged
handles must remain inheritable; the caller keeps those inheritable and closes
or marks every other descriptor before the child is reached.

## Applying a policy (worker process)

`apply` is applied by the worker to itself, as the very first statement of
`main()`, before any thread is spawned:

```rust
fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    // ... only the minimal init that must run unsandboxed ...
    if let Err(e) = sandbox::apply(&vtpm_profile()) {
        eprintln!("sandbox failed: {e}");
        std::process::exit(sandbox::EXIT_SANDBOX_FAILED);
    }
    // ... everything from here runs under the sandbox ...
    Ok(())
}
```

`apply` returns `Error` if any *required* primitive fails; the worker should
then exit with `EXIT_SANDBOX_FAILED` so the control process can distinguish a
sandbox failure from an ordinary crash.

## Tightening after initialization (optional)

Once a worker has finished the init that needs broader authority, it can shed
that authority with an additive-only `Restrictions` ratchet. Unlike `apply`, it
may run multi-threaded:

```rust
use sandbox::Restrictions;

let restrictions = Restrictions::none()
    .syscalls(&["execve", "socket", "connect"])
    .build();
sandbox::tighten(&restrictions)?;
```

## Dev escape hatch

In **debug builds only**, setting the `OPENVMM_SANDBOX_DISABLE` environment
variable makes `apply` and `tighten` no-ops so a developer can run a worker
outside its confinement while iterating. Release builds ignore it entirely: the
sandbox can never be switched off by an environment variable a compromised
process could set.

## Platform support

| Platform | `prepare` | `apply` / `tighten` |
| -------- | --------- | ------------------- |
| Linux    | yes       | yes                 |
| Windows  | yes (LPAC launch data) | not yet — returns `Error::UnsupportedPlatform` |
| other    | no        | returns `Error::UnsupportedPlatform` |
