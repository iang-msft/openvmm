//! The sandbox policy vocabulary: [`Profile`] and its widening [`Builder`],
//! plus the additive-only [`Restrictions`] ratchet consumed by
//! [`tighten`](crate::tighten).
//!
//! # Default-deny by construction
//!
//! A policy is always built from [`Profile::deny_all`], which denies every
//! ambient authority. The [`Builder`] can only *grant* — no method removes a
//! denial — so a profile is only ever as permissive as its most permissive
//! call. A worker whose profile adds nothing can reach nothing but the
//! handles the control process explicitly kept inheritable.
//!
//! # Widening vs. narrowing
//!
//! [`Builder`] widens a default-deny base at policy-authoring time.
//! [`Restrictions`] is the complementary, additive-only *narrowing* spec: it
//! can only ever subtract from an already-applied profile, so a non-monotonic
//! ratchet is unrepresentable rather than a runtime error.
//!
//! # Platform neutrality
//!
//! The vocabulary is intent-level and platform-neutral. No third-party
//! sandbox type (`landlock::*`, `seccompiler::*`, `caps::*`, `windows_sys::*`)
//! ever crosses this surface. Where a dimension has no analogue on a platform,
//! the backend treats the grant as a no-op rather than an error.
