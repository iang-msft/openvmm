//! Control-side preparation: the [`prepare`](crate::prepare) stage and the
//! plain-data [`SandboxProcessConfig`] it returns.
//!
//! # Why data, not a builder mutation
//!
//! The design's original `prepare` reached into the platform process builder
//! directly. This crate instead computes a **pure-data**
//! [`SandboxProcessConfig`] and hands it back to the caller, which merges it
//! into whatever process builder it already owns (in OpenVMM, `mesh_process`'s
//! `pal` builder). That keeps `support/sandbox` free of any dependency on
//! `mesh` or `pal`: the sandbox decides *what* the child's launch environment
//! must be; the caller decides *how* to realize it.
//!
//! # Handle hygiene is the caller's job
//!
//! There is no grant envelope and no in-crate FD sweep. [`SandboxProcessConfig`]
//! reports exactly which tagged handles must remain inheritable in
//! [`SandboxProcessConfig::inherit_handles`]; the caller is responsible for
//! keeping those inheritable and closing or marking every other descriptor
//! close-on-exec before the child is reached. Doing it caller-side means the
//! one process that owns the descriptor table is the one that decides what
//! leaves it.
